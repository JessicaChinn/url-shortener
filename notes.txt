I was not able to get the Makefile to work properly, so here are the steps you can follow

#Setup the environment and install the node modules

From the top level directory:

     cd ./backend

     npm install

navigate to the frontend directory and do the same

     cd ../frontend

     npm install

the node dependencies should be installed.


#To run the services

Navigate to the backend directory 

     cd ../backend

     npm start

once the backend is running, you can navigate to the frontend and start it

     cd ../frontend

     npm start

the browser window should open automatically, but if not you can go to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the app.


#To run tests

For the backend, make sure you're in the backend directory 

    cd ../backend 

 and run   

    npm test

the test suite should start and run through the tests.

For the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory 

cd ../frontend

and run the test suite 

    npm test

you can then type `a` to run through all of the frontend unit tests.
